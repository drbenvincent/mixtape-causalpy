# The Mixtape in CausalPy

This repository re-implements the code examples from Scott Cunningham's [*Causal Inference: The Mixtape*](https://mixtape.scunning.com) using [CausalPy](https://causalpy.readthedocs.io).

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a practical on-ramp for users who:
- Know the Mixtape's examples and want to see them in CausalPy
- Are learning CausalPy and want real-world applied examples
- Want to compare Bayesian (PyMC) vs frequentist implementations

This is a **translation repo**, not a copy of the book. We recreate analyses and figures, but link to the book for narrative context.

## Setup

Conda is required due to the PyMC dependency.

```bash
# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate it
conda activate mixtape-causalpy

# Install the local data utilities package
pip install -e .

# Add the environment as a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mixtape-causalpy --display-name "Mixtape CausalPy"

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

In Jupyter, select the **"Mixtape CausalPy"** kernel when running notebooks.

### Verify Installation

```python
import causalpy as cp
print(cp.__version__)  # Should be >= 0.4.0
```

## Chapter → Notebook Mapping

| Mixtape Chapter | Notebook | Status |
|-----------------|----------|--------|
| Ch 5: Matching & Subclassification | `05_matching.ipynb` | ⚠️ Partial (IPSW only) |
| Ch 6: Regression Discontinuity | `06_regression_discontinuity.ipynb` | ✅ Done |
| Ch 7: Instrumental Variables | `07_instrumental_variables.ipynb` | 🚧 Planned |
| Ch 8: Panel Data | `08_panel_data.ipynb` | ⏭️ TODO placeholder |
| Ch 9: Difference-in-Differences | `09_difference_in_differences.ipynb` | 🚧 Planned |
| Ch 10: Synthetic Control | `10_synthetic_control.ipynb` | 🚧 Planned |

## CausalPy-First Approach

**We implement what CausalPy supports, and skip the rest with TODO placeholders.**

CausalPy provides direct support for:
- ✅ Regression Discontinuity (`RegressionDiscontinuity`)
- ✅ Instrumental Variables (`InstrumentalVariable`)
- ✅ Difference-in-Differences (`DifferenceInDifferences`)
- ✅ Synthetic Control (`SyntheticControl`)
- ⚠️ Inverse Propensity Weighting (`InversePropensityWeighting`) — partial matching support

For methods not yet in CausalPy (NN matching, panel FE, etc.), we include TODO placeholders linking to CausalPy issues. When CausalPy adds support, we can make targeted PRs to fill in those sections.
